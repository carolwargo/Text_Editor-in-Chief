## Features

PWA Compatibility: The text editor is built as a single-page application, meeting the standards set by Progressive Web Apps. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience.

Data Persistence: The application employs multiple data persistence techniques to guarantee redundancy. In case any of the options are not supported by the user's browser, alternate methods will be used to store and retrieve data.
